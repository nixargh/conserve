conserve:
	to do:
			1. [BUG] "mail" ruby gem not installed. Inform function require it.
			                Would you like to install "mail" ruby gem? [y|n]: y
							        undefined method `write' for nil:NilClass
			2. Rewrite Add_functions#runcmd to return chomp-ed values. And fix all methods broken after that.
			3. Destroy Backup#check_mount_stat method. Need to rewrite a little two other methods.
			4. Remove duplication of remote destination mounts when do backup of multiple sources or baremetal.
			5. Add backup of multiple sources to one file.
			6. Collector#read_partitions: Write alternative partitions detection for GPT partition table.
			7. Send report without creating log file. Should create array of strings that sended to @log and send this array in report.

			+	Need to install additional packages on SLES 11:
				a. rpm -U ruby-1.8.7.p352-1.1.i586.rpm (ftp://voron-ok-radio.org/conserve/additional_rpms/SLES11/ruby-1.8.7.p352-1.1.i586.rpm)
				b. rpm -i ruby-devel-1.8.7.p352-1.1.i586.rpm (ftp://voron-ok-radio.org/conserve/additional_rpms/SLES11/ruby-devel-1.8.7.p352-1.1.i586.rpm)
				c. rpm -i rubygems-1.3.7-10.1.i586.rpm (ftp://voron-ok-radio.org/conserve/additional_rpms/SLES11/rubygems-1.3.7-10.1.i586.rpm)
				d. gem install mail
		+	3. Move all rubygems related functions to standalone Class.

		+	4. [BUG] 09/08/2011 -  - [*** "records out" not equal "records in". ***]
				when backup big partition with gzip on SLES11 sp1 physical machine (software raid 78GB).
				As i find it's because snapshot space is't enough (512M by default), snapshot size now is 80% of free PE at VG.
		+	5. Handle the situation when the folder on SMB share we need, does not exist.

	older versions:
		+	1. mount error (because mount.cifs not installed)
		+	2. "smb mount check" checks nothing
		+	3. message about snapshot deletion appears three times
		+	4. images archivation
		+	5. [BUG] 28/06/2011 - fixed at 1.8.1 - [*** "parse_and_mount" destination error: Can't mount device or network share:
				You need to install "mount.cifs"] error on SLES11.
		+	6. [BUG] 06/07/2011 - fixed at 2.0.0 - [*** undefined method `/' for nil:NilClass ***] when backuping lvm partition without LVM snapshot
		
		

restore:
	to do:
			1. REWRITE RESTORE COMPLETELY! Going to use information collected in backup process.
